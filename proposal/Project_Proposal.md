### **Project Description (1–2 pages)**

The idea is to build a web-based event booking and social networking platform designed to bring people together through shared interests and real-world experiences. Users will be able to create, join, and manage events of all types — from casual local 5v5 football matches and open-mic nights to concerts, workshops, and hobby meetups.  

The platform aims to go beyond just event discovery and booking by introducing a social element, allowing users to connect, chat, and build friendships with others who attend similar events or share common interests. This helps create a sense of community and belonging, transforming events from one-time activities into lasting social connections.  

Unlike mainstream platforms such as Ticketmaster or Eventbrite, which primarily focus on large-scale or commercial events, this app emphasizes community-driven and smaller-scale gatherings. It gives users the freedom to host their own events, whether it’s a casual football match, a study group, or a neighbourhood concert—ensuring that anyone can organize and participate, regardless of scale or budget.  

By combining event management tools with social networking features, the platform bridges the gap between digital interaction and real-world connection. It encourages people to explore nearby activities, meet others with similar passions, and stay active in their communities—all from one convenient, user-friendly web app.
