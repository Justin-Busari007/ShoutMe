### 22 September – 30 September  
The project was introduced and the scope was defined. We planned the core features, set up the GitLab repository, and created the initial frontend and backend project structure.

### 5 October – 20 October  
We worked on the React frontend setup. This included configuring routing, creating the main pages, and establishing a consistent layout for the application.

### 25 October – 15 November  
Backend development took place during this period. We implemented API endpoints to handle event data and tested communication between the backend and frontend.

### 20 November – 10 December  
We integrated backend data into the frontend. Event listings and the event details page were implemented, and initial UI improvements were made.

### 15 December – 10 January  
Map functionality was added to display event locations. We also refined the user interface and resolved issues related to data display and layout.

### 15 January – 5 February  
Debugging and testing were the main focus. We fixed frontend and backend bugs, resolved Git merge conflicts, and ensured the application worked end-to-end.

### 6 February – 20 February  
Final code cleanup, testing from a fresh pull, and completion of documentation were carried out in preparation for submission.
